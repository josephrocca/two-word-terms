# Two-Word Terms
Some word lists for terms made of two words (joined using a space, hyphen, or nothing). [Apparently](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/open-and-closed-compound-words/) these are called "compound words", but these lists are specifically for terms made of *two* words (so "mother-in-law" is not included, for example).

Sourced from several places including:
